        <p>
          As a TrustGrow affiliate, you contribute directly to the growth of our client network.
          <br />
          Every qualified referral that becomes a paying customer generates a commission for you.
          There is no cap — performance determines your upside.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-heading-4">What commission do I earn?</h2>
        <p>
          TrustGrow generally offers an affiliate commission of around 10%.  
          <br />
          However, final rates vary per case based on volume, deal size, and the type of client you
          refer. Your dedicated account manager will confirm the exact percentage for your
          partnership structure.

        <h2 class="text-heading-4">How will I know if I made a sale?</h2>
        <p>
          Each time a referred customer converts, you’ll receive an automatic confirmation. You can
          also track real-time performance, conversions, and pending payouts inside your affiliate
          dashboard.

        <h2 class="text-heading-4">Cookie duration</h2>
        <p>
          When a visitor clicks your affiliate link, a 30-day tracking cookie is activated. If the
          user purchases within this period, the referral is attributed to you — unless a later
          affiliate link overrides it.
