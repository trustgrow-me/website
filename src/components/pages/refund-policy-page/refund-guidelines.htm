        <h2>Service credits and refund guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          At TrustGrow, we aim to deliver measurable improvements in reputation, visibility, and trust.
          Because our work is highly customized and executed in stages, most services are non-refundable.
          In specific cases, we may offer a refund or service credit after a case review.

        <h2>When refunds or credits may apply</h2>
        <p>
          TrustGrow does not operate a general “no-questions-asked” money-back guarantee. <br />
          However, in limited situations we may issue a partial or full refund, or provide a service
          credit toward future work, for example when a pre-paid engagement has not yet started or a
          clearly defined deliverable has not been provided.
        </p>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.5" class="space-y-3">
        <h2>Conditions for review</h2>
        <p>Your request may be considered for a refund or service credit if</p>

          class="mt-6 space-y-3 list-inside text-tagline-1 font-normal text-secondary/60 dark:text-accent/60"

          <li>You contact us within a reasonable time after the invoiced service period.</li>
          <li>The requested work has not yet started or can be demonstrably cancelled without cost.</li>
          <li>A clearly scoped deliverable has not been provided as described in writing.</li>
          <li>There is a confirmed billing error or duplicate charge.</li>

          Requests based purely on preference changes, lack of long-term results, or external platform
          decisions (such as algorithm changes or review moderation) are generally not eligible.

        <p>
          Once a refund or credit has been approved, processing times may vary depending on your

          display the adjustment on your statement.

        <p>
          As a general rule, TrustGrow engagements are non-refundable once work has started. In
          particular, the following situations are typically not eligible:
        </p>
        <ul

          <li>Changes in preference after work has been executed in line with the agreed scope.</li>
          <li>Outcomes impacted by third-party platforms, algorithms, or moderation decisions.</li>
          <li>Requests based on expectations that were not documented or agreed in writing.</li>
          <li>Downgrades or cancellations requested after extensive use of ongoing services.</li>
