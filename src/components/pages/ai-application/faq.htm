                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks
                typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning,
                problem-solving, and decision-making. AI technologies include machine learning,
                natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

                Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from
                experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to analyze data,
                identify patterns, and make predictions, forming the foundation for most modern AI
                applications.

              Is Artificial Intelligence taking over human jobs?

                While AI is automating certain tasks, it's more accurate to say it's transforming
                jobs rather than eliminating them. AI creates new opportunities and enhances human
                capabilities, requiring workers to adapt and develop new skills rather than being
                completely replaced.

              What are the various types of Artificial Intelligence?

                AI can be categorized into three main types: Narrow AI (task-specific, like Siri),
                General AI (human-level intelligence across all domains), and Super AI (surpassing
                human intelligence). Currently, we only have Narrow AI, with General AI being the
                next major milestone.
